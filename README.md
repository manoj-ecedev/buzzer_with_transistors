# ðŸ”” Buzzer Control Using NPN and PNP Transistors

This repository contains two simple Arduino projects that demonstrate how to control a buzzer using transistors â€” one using an **NPN** transistor and the other using a **PNP** transistor. These are beginner-friendly circuits that help you understand how transistors work as switches.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### ðŸ”¹ [`npn_version/`](https://github.com/manoj-ecedev/buzzer_with_transistors/tree/main/buzzer_with_transistors/npn_version))
Controls the buzzer using an **NPN transistor** like 2N2222 or BC547.  
The transistor turns ON when the Arduino sends a **HIGH** signal.

### ðŸ”¸ [`pnp_version/`](pnp_version)
Controls the buzzer using a **PNP transistor** like BC557.   
The transistor turns ON when the Arduino sends a **LOW** signal.
